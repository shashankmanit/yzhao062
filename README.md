### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am pursuing a [Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Public Policy (expected)](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/joint-phd-mlpp.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am the author/core developer of various machine learning tools and systems with more than millions of downloads.

🔭 I mainly focus on:

- data mining topics related to scalability, reliability, and automation and
- information systems questions related to interaction, trade-off, and cooperation between human and “AI”

😄 I am open to:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2021). I could legally work in United States, Canada, and China.

📫 Contact me by:
- Email (zhaoy [AT] cmu.edu) or 
- [WeChat (微信)](http://localhost:1313/user/yuezhao2/files/ID_zhaoyueyue1002.JPG).
