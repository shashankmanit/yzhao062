### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), 
and an ex management consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).
As a seasoned ML software/system architect, I have led/participated [> 10 ML libraries initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), 9,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 800 out of 40M GitHub users), and >300,0000 total downloads.

**Regarding Leetcode style interview**: I strongly dislike the general programming interview, and would NOT do this type of "tests". 
You can trust my coding and design capacity :)

And of course, I am still a ML/DM researcher at the end of the day.

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **data mining** topics related to **outlier detection** and **ensemble learning**
- **machine learning systems (MLSys)** that can speed up or scale up data mining algorithms 
- **information systems** problems related to **interaction, trade-off, and cooperation between human and "AI"** 

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2022). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

💬 **News & Travel**:

- **Jan 2021**: Have a new system paper ([SUOD: Accelerating Large-scale Unsupervised Heterogeneous Outlier Detection](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/21-mlsys-suod.pdf)) accepted at [onference on Machine Learning Systems (MLSys' 21)](https://mlsys.org/). SUOD is an acceleration system for large-scale unsupervised outlier detection.

- **Jan 2021**: We have a new library [PyHealth](https://github.com/yzhao062/PyHealth) released for more than 30 state-of-the-art predictive health algorithms (mostly deep learning based).
See [the corresponding paper](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/21-preprint-pyhealth.pdf) under review at JMLR as well!

- **Dec 2020**: Thrilled to join [Prof. Jure Leskovek](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/) @ Stanford University for a research internship/visit in 2021:) See u in CA (if not remotely)!

- **Nov 2020**: [Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/TDC/), a large collection of > 60 machine learning-ready datasets across more than 20 therapeutic tasks, is released. 
Great work led by [Prof. Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/) and [Kexin Huang](https://www.kexinhuang.com/) from Havard!

- **Oct 2020**: Our demo paper [TODS: An Automated Time Series Outlier Detection System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09822.pdf) is accepted at [AAAI 2021](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/aaai21demoscall/).
See the new Python library [TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods) [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0bBXuDUe7s&feature=youtu.be) designed for time-series outlier detection. It is initialized and led by [DATA Lab @ Texas A&M University](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/xiahu/people.html); 
I contribute to core detection model design and implementation.

- **Oct 2020**: Our paper [AutoAudit: Mining Accounting and Time-Evolving Graphs](https://github.com/mengchillee/AutoAudit) will appear in [BigData 2020](http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2020/). It is a system for
detecting anomalies in time-evolving graphs. Great work with Meng-Chieh Lee, Aluna Wang, Pierre Jinghong Liang, Leman Akoglu, Vincent S. Tseng, and Christos Faloutsos!

- **Sep 2020**: We have a new paper [Automating Outlier Detection via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10606) ([code](https://github.com/yzhao062/MetaOD)) out. In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised meta-learner that can select (recommend) the most performing outlier detection model on an arbitrary dataset.
