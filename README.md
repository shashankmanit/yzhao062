### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), 
and an ex management consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).
As a seasoned ML software/system architect, I have led/participated [> 10 ML libraries initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), 9,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 800 out of 40M GitHub users), and >300,0000 total downloads.

**Regarding Leetcode style interview**: I strongly dislike the general programming interview, and would NOT do this type of "tests". 
You can trust my coding and design capacity :)

And of course, I am still a ML/DM researcher at the end of the day.

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **data mining** topics related to **outlier detection** and **ensemble learning**
- **machine learning systems (MLSys)** that can speed up or scale up data mining algorithms 
- **information systems** problems related to **interaction, trade-off, and cooperation between human and "AI"** 

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2022). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

💬 **News & Travel**:

- **Feb 2021**: [Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/TDC/), a large collection of > 60 machine learning-ready datasets across more than 20 therapeutic tasks, is released. See [paper on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09548)!
Great work led by [Kexin Huang](https://www.kexinhuang.com/) and [Prof. Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/) from Havard!

- **Jan 2021**: Have a new system paper ([SUOD: Accelerating Large-scale Unsupervised Heterogeneous Outlier Detection](papers/21-mlsys-suod.pdf)) accepted at [Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MLSys)](https://mlsys.org/). [SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/SUOD) is an
acceleration system for large-scale unsupervised outlier detection with [Xiyang Hu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/xiyanghu/). It has been downloaded by more than 900,000 times, included as part of [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod).

- **Jan 2021**: We have a new library [PyHealth](https://github.com/yzhao062/PyHealth) released for more than 30 state-of-the-art predictive health algorithms (mostly deep learning based).
See [the corresponding paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04209) as well!


- **Dec 2020**: Thrilled to join [Prof. Jure Leskovek](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/) @ Stanford University for a research internship/visit in 2021:)
